<h2>How to read this tutorial?</h2>
<p>This tutorial provides clear steps and commands which must be executed sequentially as it is listed. I strongly recommend not to skip any step, except <i>Workaround</i> step if all forward commands will no raise any errors.</p>

<h2>Hands on set up your EC2 Instances</h2>
<p>In this part we will closely work on initialzied AWS EC2 instances. Keep in mind that in order to complete this part sucessfully, you should be opened all 3 terminal windows during all steps. Here 1 terminal window is dedicated to <b>Master slave</b>, while other two to <b>Worker nodes</b>. So in total we are having 3 nodes (1 + 2).<b>Noticing that this manual was prepared in Mac, so slightly differences may be using different OS, such as Windows.</p>

<h3>Step 0. Prepare your SSH Private key for safe connections</h3>
<p>First of all, put you SSH key to a special folder in your machine. Keep SSH key filnename be easy to type and recognize such as <i>kubernetes-dev.pem</i> (we will use this filename furthermore in this manual).</p>
